When I was a child, one time my dad told me a story about a group of robbers sitting under a blade of grass. The story went something like this:

> In the depth of night, seven robbers sat hidden in the shadow of a blade of grass. The leader of the group stood up and said "Pedro, tell us a story."
> Pedro stood up and started speaking: "In the depth of night, seven robbers sat hidden in the shadow of a blade of grass..."

I loved this story and the [recursive](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) nature of it. My dad would take a lot of joy in making the story, which apparently is an old joke from the 50s, more and more elaborate, and turn it from three sentences into a 20 minute tale.

This is not just repetition â€“ each time you actually go a level deeper. You could imagine the story ending like this:

> He finished his story, sat down, and took a swig of his ale." Pedro finished his story, sat down, and took a swig of his ale.

Recursion in storytelling still really grabs me. I found another example this morning, in the lyrics of a song by _RUBII_ called [Botb](https://genius.com/Rubii-botb-lyrics) that I really like:

> I've got some big bossin' b's, and some boys on the block
> I call them a couple G's, and they think that I'm hot
> ...
> There's no debating, the consensus is
> I've got some big bossin' b's, and some boys on the block
> ...

Makes an already great song even better!
