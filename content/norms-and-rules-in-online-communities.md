I've been spending a lot of time recently thinking about the governance of online communities. One helpful starting point for this is the [Preece & Maloney-Krichmar](https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/10/4/JCMC10410/4614449) definition of online communities:

> The _people_ who come together for a particular _purpose_, and who are guided by _policies_ (including norms and rules) and supported by _software_

My thinking has always been that communities need to develop their own norms, and should enforce those themselves. Tools might be provided to help with this (possibly to a select number of moderators within the community), but the majority of the responsibility lies with the community itself.

In trying to grow some of the online communities I help facilitate, I realised it isn't quite as simple. Yes - tech that enforces hard rules (you can do X, you can't do Y) might actually serve a purpose in certain scenarios. 

Especially at the early stages of a community (or a newly created sub-community), being prescriptive with rules and enforcing them from the top down might be a good practice, as self-enforcement and development of community norms can happen efficiently within a pre-defined framework than within a fully blank space.

I still feel however like software should not be the primary driver of any policies, but applied as a tool: the community needs to feel like they are in control for there to be an environment where collective norms can grow.
