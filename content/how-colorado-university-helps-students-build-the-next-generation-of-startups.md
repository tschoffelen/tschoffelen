This morning, we spoke at Colorado University with [Brad Bernthal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradbernthal), professor of law and [Techstars](http://www.techstars.com/) mentor. He has spent the last few years researching and supporting the Boulder startup community. He talked to us about what role he thinks a university should take in a startup environment, and what it is that Colorado University offers to their students in Boulder. Below is a short overview of the programs they offer.

## Pre-accelerator program

Students and faculty can take part in a semester-long program that offers a preparation track for people with ideas that want to turn their idea into a real business.

This program consists of 3 phases:

1. **Noise making**  
    This phase is meant to provide inspiration through a host of events, as well as forming a team and [finding a mentor for your business](https://medium.com/all-sparks/great-startup-mentorship-101-2a1baf060a9#.pddb56g9v). Those mentors can be serial entrepreneurs, functional specialists (CFOs, legal experts, etc.), investors and community connectors.
2. **Company creation and development**  
    During this phase the mentorship really begins, combined with a series of workshops to help the startups progress as quickly as possible and tackle any pain points that the startups experience.
3. **Competitions**  
    The pre-accelerator program ends with a series of pitch events, where the startups are brought in contact with different audiences, depending on the category their company falls under. This all ends in a big Oscars-like party, where the startup that did the most for the community is awarded a price.

## Entrepreneurs Unplugged

Organised by [Silicon Flatirons](http://www.siliconflatirons.com/events.php?id=entreUnplugged), every month the Colorado Law University invites a serial entrepreneur to tell his or her story to a group of students (and the public, it’s open for everyone!) for about an hour, and discuss any interesting problems or experiences they had in the past.

## Spark Boulder Co-Working Space

Set up by Fletcher Richman in 2013, [Spark](http://sparkboulder.com/) is a co-working space in Boulder created by & for students. Currently, there are more than 35 companies residing here, of which about 30 are companies of students from CU.

## Startup summer

During the summer, CU connects students, including students from other states, to local companies for summer internships. If the students are interested in exploring entrepreneurship opportunities, they [are offered the possibility](http://www.startupcolorado.com/startup-summer) to work as an intern during the day, and work on their own startups in the evening and participate in startup events.
