One of the things I really enjoy about the co-founders I've currently surrounded myself with, is our shared goal of longevity.

We're not trying to build businesses that have hockeystick growth projections, or stressing about month-on-month revenue growth. We're focussing on building what we believe in, and attracting people that share those beliefs to use our products. 

I believe very strongly that that's the only consistent way to build something long-lasting. Premature growth, both in revenue or in team size, will eventually lead to instability. I like staying small until we're certain about what we're doing.

That of course is easier if you have previous businesses that are profitable, and are able to pour those profits into taking time to build something new slowly.

I want my company to be like a family farm that still exists 90 years later, not like a startup that has to lay off 200 people because it grew slightly less quick last quarter.
