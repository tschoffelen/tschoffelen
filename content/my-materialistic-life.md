I’d like to think that we live two types of lives: a idealistic one, and a materialistic one. And we live those two lives simultaneously, always trying (or failing) to strike a balance between the two.

This month I’m leaving London, after having lived here for more than a year. And between all of the emotions that causes, there’s one thing I feel extremely good about: I once more was able to reduce my materialistic life to something that fits into one suitcase and a backpack.

I get great joy out of throwing stuff away. I am privileged in that I really only need this metal slab that I’m currently typing this on, and some cables, to work and advance my career. Other than that I carry a phone, a notebook, a pile of unread novels, my high school yearbook, and a few sets of clothes.
