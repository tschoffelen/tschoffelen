My [daily notes](https://help.obsidian.md/plugins/daily-notes) in Obsidian are the cornerstone of my note taking and journaling. 

I don't really review old daily notes too often, but once a year, in December, I'll look back at the past year's notes day-by-day and write a little overview of the important events and things I learned in that past year.

It's a great way to reflect on what the year has brought me, and remind myself of all of the beautiful experiences I've had.

It's also great to look back on old links and resources I've saved for later, that I never actually managed to look at. It's a lot of work, but it's also very fulfilling. 

On to a new year, and maybe at some point (end of the decade?), I'll review these yearly review notes!
