I don’t believe software has intrinsic value, but I think it can serve as a powerful tool to help people do good in society. That’s why I love creating well-designed user interfaces for real people and crafting tools for developers to build better software.

Looking for something fun to do while waiting for my mom, a primary school teacher, to finish grading her students’ homework, led me to start programming at age 11.

At age 16, I co-founded my first startup [Scholica](https://infowijs.nl/?utm_source=schof.co), which primarily focussed on created learning apps for K-12 education in The Netherlands, and later became part of [Infowijs](https://infowijs.nl/?utm_source=schof.co).

After high school, I moved to London to co-found [NearSt](https://near.st/?utm_source=schof.co), a company providing modern commerce tools for thousands of physical retailers worldwide.

I’m currently spending my time building [Examplary](https://examplary.ai/?utm_source=schof.co), in addition to my work with [Street Art Cities](https://streetartcities.com/?utm_source=schof.co) and [Ministry of Urban Culture](https://ministryofurbanculture.com/?utm_source=schof.co), as well as writing about tech.

I'm available for consultancy and speaking engagements for topics like serverless architecture design, product strategy, developing for open source, and more.
